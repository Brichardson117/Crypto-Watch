# Crypto Watch

## Overview
We created Crypto Watch! A new app where you can monitor your favorite Crypto currencies! 
We created a list of the 20 most popular currencies that you can added to watch list and keep up with their current values in real time. From Bitcoin, DogeCoin, to Polkadot you can monitior them all from Crypto Watch.
We've also included a section to see what people are talking about on Reddit regarding the latest news in crypto.

We worked around the clock using Html, CSS and JavaScript to create a super cool and unique crypto monitoring website that can be used on any device. And we used APIs from Reddit to shows what others are talking about in crypto and Coincap to get the cypto latest values and market caps for the Crypto currenices in your watch list
