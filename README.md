# Crypto Watch

## Overview
We created Crypto Watch! A new app where you can monitior your favorite Crypto currencies!\ 
We created a list of the 20 most popular currencies that you can be added to your personal watch list.

We worked around the clock using Html, CSS and JavaScript to create a super cool and unique crypto monitoring website that can be used on any device. And we used APIs from Reddit to shows what others are talking about in crypto and Coincap to get the cypto latest values and market caps for the Crypto currenices in your watch list
